# Purpose
Analyze and optimize code performance.

## Instructions
1. Profile code execution
2. Identify bottlenecks:
   - Inefficient algorithms
   - Unnecessary operations
   - Memory leaks
   - I/O issues

3. Suggest specific optimizations
4. Estimate performance gains

## Report Format
### Bottlenecks Found
- [Location]: Impact level
- [Location]: Impact level

### Optimizations
- [Suggestion]: Expected improvement
